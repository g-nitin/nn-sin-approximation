# Neural Network Approximation of sin(x)

## Description

This repository contains Python code for a neural network that approximates the sin(x) function.

The code demonstrates how to:
- Load and prepare PyTorch tensors for data.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Create a data loader for batch processing.
- Define and train a neural network model.
- Evaluate the model's performance on test data.
- Make predictions using the trained model.
- Plot the actual sin(x) function and the model's predictions for visualization.
